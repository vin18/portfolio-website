          . Whenever I am not coding, I am probably reading, watching good
          movies/tv show or preparing some good jokes so I can make my loved
          ones (mostly my sisters) laugh. I enjoy playing chess which I fell in
          love with since the age of 8, won few medals, lost a ton of
          tournaments, the love is only growing for chess. I am a huge Marvel
          fan and my favorite trilogy is The Dark Knight. If you want to connect

          . I love having conversations with like minded folks, learn from them
          and highly believe in growing together. I have been blessed with a
          privileged life and I am grateful and trying to make the best out of
          it.

          Fun fact: I try to live a low key, private and a simpler life.
          Skipping parties or any random events due to which most of the people
          have stopped inviting me and as an introvert I am not complaining!
